# Predicting Restaurant Success Using Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews and Rating Trends

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for restaurant success by analyzing online reviews and rating trends.  The analysis incorporates sentiment analysis techniques to identify key indicators within customer reviews that correlate with restaurant profitability and longevity. The model leverages historical rating data and textual sentiment to predict future performance, providing insights valuable for restaurant owners and investors.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics of the data, sentiment scores, and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the following visualizations will be generated and saved in the `output` directory:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line plot showing the trend of restaurant sales or ratings over time.
* `sentiment_distribution.png`: A bar chart illustrating the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the reviews.
  *(Further visualizations may be generated depending on the specific models and analyses implemented.)*

## Data

The project requires a dataset containing restaurant reviews and ratings.  The specific format and source of the data are detailed within the project's notebooks and documentation.  A sample dataset (if applicable) can be found in the `data` directory.
